## üöÄ Features

- **Detect IP-based URLs:** Flags URLs using raw IP addresses instead of domains (common in phishing).  
- **Suspicious Character Detection:** Identifies `@` and `-` symbols often used in phishing URLs.  
- **Subdomain Analysis:** Detects excessive subdomains to identify deceptive URLs.  
- **Typosquatting Detection:** Uses **Levenshtein Distance** to flag domains similar to trusted ones (e.g., `paypa1.com` vs `paypal.com`).  
- **Interactive Scanner:** Users can input URLs/IPs for real-time analysis.  
- **Recruiter-Friendly:** Demonstrates understanding of phishing defense, URL security, and algorithmic thinking.

## üìÇ How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samhitha7613/Phishing-URL-Detector.git
cd Phishing-URL-Detector

```
## 2. Compile the program

```bash

```
## 3. Run the program

```bash
./phishing_detector
```
## 4. Enter URLs or IPs to analyze
```bash
Example: Enter a URL or IP to analyze: http://paypa1.com/login
```

### he tool will display warnings or confirm that the URL looks safe.

## Example Output

```bash
üîé Analyzing: http://paypa1.com/login
‚ùå Contains suspicious characters (@ or -)
‚ö†Ô∏è Looks similar to paypal.com (possible typosquatting)

üîé Analyzing: https://paypal.com
‚úÖ URL looks safe
```
